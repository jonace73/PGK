Thus, if the axiom is not illogical then so is the belief on God#@#s existence even without proof.TC# #LF# #PT#NBHowever, any axiom must not contradict reality. The belief on the existence of a loving God TP##PBcontradictsBP##PT#NB the fact that many humans experienced terrible sufferings and hardships.TP# #CT#NBIf every man does TC##CBnot feel painBC##CT#NB; Even if eaten by a wild animal, he will not feel pain, and his loved ones will not miss him and be hurt by his predicament. Hence, he will not evade wild animals, will not be saved by his loved ones, and more likely will die of unnatural causes. Thus, pain helps us to survive.TC# #LF# #PT#NBSo why does God still created TP##PBthings harmfulBP##PT#NB and pain-inflicting to humans?TP# #CT#NBThere is a saying that necessity is the mother of invention. Look at the birds, they just fly to travel, so they do not need to create airplanes. On the other hand, humans can not fly, swim like a fish, and run like a horse. Thus, to reduce tiredness (a form of pain) in travelling, they invented airplanes, ships, etc. In short, pain motivates them to TC##CBbecome inventive/intelligentBC##CT#NB. Becoming intelligent is a form of growth, and the will to make anything grow is referred to as love. Thus, human sufferings and hardships are forms of God#@#s love. This is a sort of love akin to that of a father who forces his lazy son to be hardworking (a form of growth) even if the son dislikes (a form of pain) it. Thus, the presence of the said pains does not contradict the believe on the existence of a loving God.TC#,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30
Divine>God Exists>Philosophy->Why create?,#DB#,Why does the Judeo-Christian God have to create?,#DB#,The essence of the Judeo-Christian #BLGod is loveLB#. Consequently, He needs to create humans for Him to have people to love; even if the created may suffer in their lives or choose to be in hell after death. The choice is permitted by God out of His love also. Analogously, because of the love of human parents, they produce children despite knowing that these children may suffer when they grow.,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30
Divine>God Exists>Philosophy->Tragedy,#DB#,There is no loving God as He did not prevented accidents or calamities.,#DB#,Suppose someone throws a rock to kill his enemy. If God will prevent the rock to hit the enemy, how can humans learn the physics of thrown objects? If there is #BLno physicsLB#, we can not create rockets, airplanes, etcetera. In addition, how humans can predict the actions of things if these actions are interfered by God? The predictability of the actions gives confidence to early scientists to work on Science which yields a myriad of good things (e.g., medicines, conveniences, and entertainments) and shows humans to be more intelligent than animals. Thus, for #BLhumans to become intelligentLB#, God did not interfere on the physics of things, i.e., including the physics that led to accidents and calamities. Becoming intelligent is a form of growth, and the will to make anything grow is referred to as love. Thus, the said non-interference is a form of God#@#s love.,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30
Divine>God Exists>Philosophy->First Cause,#DB#,What is the concept called the First Cause developed by St. Thomas Aquinas?.,#DB#,St. Thomas Aquinas developed the idea referred to as, the First Cause [#PRAnthony Kenny#MD#author: Anthony Kenny#CR#title: Studies in Ethics and the Philosophy of Religion. The Five Ways: St Thomas Aquinas#@# Proofs of God#@#s Existence#CR#publisher: eBook#CR#year: 2013PR#]. What is this? Suppose you ask what causes a coconut to fall. The answer is, the Earth#@#s gravity pulls the coconut. Let us label this cause as C1. Suppose you ask further, what causes gravity? The cause is the curvature of space-time [#PRJonathan Allday#MD#author: Jonathan Allday#CR#title: Space-time An Introduction to Einstein#@#s Theory of Gravity#CR#publisher: CRC Press#CR#year: 2019PR#]. Let us label this cause as C2. Suppose you question and search for the cause successively for 98 times more; Let the last cause be labelled as C100, assumed to exist. #LF# Now, if you ask for the cause of C100 but can not find an answer (cause C101), you cannot explain cause C100. And if you can not explain the cause of C100 you can not explain cause of C99. If this approach is repeatedly applied you cannot explain C1, i.e., the ultimate cause why the coconut falls. #LF# Now, if you will not stop the questioning and looking for the causes, you will reach the cause Cinfinity which can never be found because the count is already infinite. Thus, if you will not stop searching for the cause, you can never explain cause C1, as implied above. To find the ultimate cause of C1, based on the above discussion, you need to stop looking for the cause of a certain cause, say C700, and accept that it has no cause (i.e., there is no cause C701) and cannot be explained. Thus, you need to accept that there is a cause (e.g., God) that is not caused and cannot be explained for you to find the ultimate cause of anything (e.g., the formation of the universe) except itself. The uncaused cause (or the First Cause) is defined as God (by St. Thomas Aquinas) who is the cause of everything, including the universe, except Himself. This is a justification that #BLGod must existLB#, otherwise there will be #BLno ultimate causeLB# of everything observed, except Himself. #LF# However, some physicists claimed that using Quantum Mechanics [#PRAndrei Linde#MD#author: Andrei Linde#CR#title: Stochastic approach to tunneling and baby universe formation#CR#journal: Nuclear Physics B#CR#volume: 372#CR#pages: 421--442#CR#year: 1992PR#] the universe just pops to existence without any cause. They mean, there is no God who created the universe. Now, #BLQuantum Mechanics has several questionable fundamental principlesLB# (e.g., the measurement problem [#PRF. Muller#MD#author: F. Muller#CR#title: Non-Reflexive Logics, Non-Individuals and the Philosophy of QuantumMechanics#CR#journal: Nuclear Physics B#CR#publisher: Springer-Verlag#CR#year: 2023PR#]), such that, it can be false or illogical that the universe is uncaused. On the other hand, the principle of First Cause of St. Aquinas is shown above to be logical; thus, this is a better proof of how the universe comes to exist, i.e., through the First Cause who is God.,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30
Divine>God Exists>Philosophy->Reason alone,#DB#,Only reason must be used and no faith.,#DB#,There are humans portrayed in the movie #SQThe Matrix#SQ [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix">Wachowskis</a>] where each of them is lying inside a tube and has an electronic device stuck in their head that makes them aware, not of reality (where the tubes and their bodies are), but of a simulated world, i.e., a virtual reality. Now, in our situation, we are not #BLreally sure if what is realityLB#, we might be in the same situation as the people portrayed in the movie. Thus, if you accept that what you are aware of is derived from reality, then that is faith. Thus, sometimes the exercise of faith is reasonable [#PRDom Antoine Marie#MD#author: Dom Antoine Marie#CR#title: GK Chesterton#CR#journal: The Chesterton Review#CR#volume: 43#CR#number: 1/2#CR#pages: 288--296#CR#year: 2017PR#, <a href="https://www.catholic.com/audio/sp/how-science-proves-gods-existence">Joe Heschmeyer</a>].,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30

Hameroff</a>], the problem on how and why humans are conscious. Considering that consciousness has unknown nature and cannot be examined by Science [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaZbCctlll4">Jeffrey Kaplan</a>] (for being subjective), no one can deny its possible persistence beyond human death. Now, if you deny God#@#s existence (which is a sin) and He does not exist, nobody will judge your sins, and you will not suffer after death. However, if God does exist, you might suffer after death. Thus, even if God#@#s existence is not proven, it is #BLbetter to believe on His existence, you will lose nothingLB#. This concept is referred to as the Pascal#@#s wager [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_wager">wikipedia</a>].,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30
Divine>God Exists>Philosophy->Cruel God,#DB#,The God in the Bible is unjustifiably cruel, such that, it is unbelievable He exists.,#DB#,This has several answers: (1) It is never known that the Bible fell from the sky, transcription of God#@#s whispers, or written by humans possessed by God. Thus, the free will of the authors have influence on the writing of the Bible. This is analogous to the writing of a child guided by his teacher. If the teacher is the only one who writes, the writing could have been perfect. However, due to the free will of the child the writing is crooked. Thus, the crookedness (extreme violence) in the Bible could be due to the #BLfree will of the authorsLB#, although inspired by God (the teacher). That is why there is a need of a church of God who will abrogate the crooked biblical messages influenced by the authors#@# free will and teach true God#@#s biblical messages. #LF# (2) Some immoral dictates in the Old Testament need not be followed till eternity, but only on the age of the ancient Israelites. For example, Jesus Christ implied that God the Father, through Moses, permitted polygamy because the ancient Israelites were stubborn [#PRMatthew 19:8#MD#He said to them: #DQAlthough Moses permitted you to separate from your wives, due to the hardness of your heart, it was not that way from the beginning.PR#], i.e., God considers the moral conditions of the ancient Israelites. It is not that God changes His mind but rather it is His plan considering the #BLmoral immaturity of the ancient IsraelitesLB#. #LF# (3) From [#PRGenesis 6:5--7#MD#Then God, seeing that the wickedness of men was great upon the earth and that every thought of their heart was intent upon evil at all times, repented that he had made man on the earth. And being touched inwardly with a sorrow of heart, he said, #DQI will eliminate man, whom I have created, from the face of the earth, from man to other living things, from animals even to the flying things of the air. For it grieves me that I have made them.#DQPR#], God destroyed sinful humans. This is akin to the second world war, where the allied forces annihilated the Germans and Japanese to prevent further destruction of lives and properties . . . This is not cruelty. Analogously, God destroyed the sinful humans to #BLprevent them from influencingLB# their would-be descendants of their sins . . . This is not cruelty. #LF# (4) A marble was rejected by Leonardo da Vinci due to its low quality. It is accepted by Michaelangelo who carved it into a beautiful statue, that can be seen today in the Vatican [<a href="http://changingthetimes.net/samples/10to16/da_vinci_agrees_to_sculpt_david.htm">Jeff Provine</a>]. The lesson here is the #BLacceptance of ugly and transform it into beautifulLB#. The cruelty related in the Bible is not meant to be followed but rather only shows that God receives a base people (the ancient Israelites), and that He shapes (i.e., loves) them to be better (good enough for His Son to be born into), a process that supports the proof of His existence.,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30
Divine>God Exists>Philosophy->Biblical errors,#DB#,The Bible has several errors; and hence cannot be trusted, including its claim that God exists.,#DB#,There are several answers to this: (1) There could indeed be erroneous science-related statements in the Bible. Even then, the #BLBible is not a Science bookLB#; instead, it was created to teach people to love God and their fellow humans. Thus, any science-related statements written in the Bible are not declared as true or false by the church. #LF# (2) The Bible is wrong as there should be no serpent in paradise: Humans have inherent attitude to indulge in positive sensations. By the freedom God gave humans, a person may act to indulge in positive sensations even if these can harm him/her or other people (e.g., substance abuse). This is akin to the story of Adam and Eve. As they would like to taste the sweetness of the forbidden fruit they suffered. Thus, #BLevil (snake) is inside of Adam and EveLB#, and not in paradise (contrary to what Bakunin, a friend of Karl Marx, promoted [17]). The story may not indeed happened and may just be a parable to illustrate human propensity to indulge in positive sensations, and human freedom that sometimes leads them to commit sin. The freedom is granted by God out of His love of humans, and the propensity is necessary for us to grow when geared towards goodness (e.g., creating TV for entertainment).,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30

Divine>God Exists>Science->Existence,#DB#,There is no need to prove God does not exist.,#DB#,One business in Mathematics is to prove that some mathematical entities do or do not exist.

Divine>God Exists>Science->Invisible God,#DB#,It does not make sense to believe that God exists as nobody had seen Him.,#DB#,There are unobservable entities but believed to exist. For example, gravity cannot be seen and yet accepted as existent. The invisible black holes (no light can escape from them due to their extreme gravitational pull), dark matter and energy are believed to exist, as their existence explains the observations in, and fits with the principles of, Physics [#PRBarbara Hoffert#MD#author: Barbara Hoffert#CR#title: Black Holes: The Key to Understanding the Universe#CR#publisher: REED BUSINESS INFORMATION 360 PARK AVENUE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA#CR#year: 2022PR#].

Circumstantial evidences, that explains the crime in no uncertain terms, can be enough to pass the verdict. As implied above, this methodology is also applied in Science. Thus, if it is #BLnot amenableLB# to atheists then they must also #BLreject some scientific knowledgeLB# and court verdicts made using it. On the other hand, if it is amenable to them, then they have to accept the existence of God as there are numerous circumstantial evidences pointing to His existence, such as the Big Bang [#PRStephen W.

Divine>God Exists>Science->Chance,#DB#,God did not create the physical laws, rather they were formed by chance.,#DB#,The coconut, stone, and other objects fall as every object vertically above a hard surface and inside the Earth falls when released. This explanation is only appropriate to one type of event (falling objects), such that it is weak compared to the Law of Universal Gravitation. Because, this law can be used to explain so much more types of events (e.g., falling objects, object dynamics, and planetary motion). It abides by the basic #BLprinciple of explanationLB# (conceived by Aristotle) that states: #SQThe cause of an event must be greater or more powerful than the event itself.#SQ [<a href="https://www.catholic.com/magazine/print-edition/can-gods-existence-be-proved">Kenneth Howell</a>]. #LF# Now, #BLpure chanceLB# is used as a cause in much #BLlesserLB# fields of study (e.g., noise analysis) than physical laws (e.g., Quantum Mechanics, chemical reactions, particle interactions, etcetera). Meaning, physical laws as cause are more powerful in explaining than pure chance. Based on the aforementioned principle the latter cannot be the cause of the former. #LF# #BLGod as a cause is more powerfulLB# in explaining than physical laws as not only that He can be used to explain physical laws but also on everything (e.g., morality, miracles, etcetera) as He is the First Cause (find and then tap the tab with the keyword #SQFirst Cause#SQ to know this), i.e., the root cause of all causes.

Divine>God Exists>Science->Evolution,#DB#,The complicated cell constituting the body of living organisms are formed by chance and evolution over a long period of time.,#DB#,The sliced area of a mango will turn blackish few hours after the slice due to the oxidation of the cells on the area. Oxidation also occurs in the various molecules not quickly assembled #DS after each one of them is separately formed #DS to supposedly create the primordial living cell; The oxidation of some or all of them prevents the cell formation. Now, considering their number and difference in chemistry, it is extremely unlikely that they are formed almost simultaneously and then quickly assembled to create the cell. More likely, they will not be formed almost simultaneously, such that, even if one of them is formed the others already oxidized as the assembling did not happen quickly enough. Even if they, including the oxidized molecules, are assembled no living cell will be formed. In addition, they need to be assembled in correct order; otherwise the cell will not be formed, last long, or produce offsprings. Thus, they need to be #BLformed almost simultaneously then quickly assembledLB# in correct order to form the very complex primordial living cell [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v36_v4hsB-Y">James Tour</a>]. This process is a miracle if it happened by chance. If that is the case, it is analogous to an explosion of a junkyard where the thrown metal pieces incidentally landed to form a functioning fighter jet. #LF# As mentioned, the molecules need to be assembled almost instantaneously for the cell to be formed. They should not be attached one after another over a long period of time, a process referred to as the chemical evolution. In fact, #BLtime is the enemyLB# of organic compounds [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v36_v4hsB-Y">James Tour</a>]. Thus, even after a long period of chemical evolution, still no primordial living cell can be formed.

However, there are fossilised footsteps of dinosaurs beside that of humans. Meaning, there is a period when they both existed. (b) The theory of evolution cannot explain why petrified upright standing tree trunks are cutting through millions of years of rock layers.

(c) Genetic mutation was found to degrade, rather than enhance, the human cell; this is referred to as genetic entropy.

Divine>God Exists>Miracles->Guadalupe,#DB#,Is the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe miraculous?,#DB#,The image of a woman (believed to be the Virgin Mary) appeared in 1531 A.D. on the tilma of St. Juan Diego. The tilma is made of weak cactus fiber that usually disintegrates after 15 to 20 years, but still preserve to this day. Using a microscope, the eyes of the woman in the image have the reflection of humans thought to be present when the image on the tilma was first shown. The image has no paint, brush strokes, nor under sketch, and proven not drawn by human; It #BLlooks like a photocopyLB# which was invented just last century. Thus, it can never be created by any human on 1531 A.D. [<a href="https://www.catholiccompany.com/magazine/the-miraculous-image-of-our-lady-of-guadalupe/">Gretchen Filz</a>]. This must be a miracle. #LF# Bonus: The mantle of the woman in the image has a figure of stars. In place of each of these stars, let us put a hole, referred to here as the mantle hole, and then let us move to the back of the tilma. From a vantage point, in each of the mantle holes can be seen a single unique star in the group of stars in heaven, referred to here as the mantle stars, when the image was first revealed. Above the mantle stars is another group of stars called corona (Latin for crown). Suppose we put another set of holes, referred to here as crown holes, on the tilma where from each of them one can see a single unique corona star, such that, all of the corona and mantle stars can be seen from the corona and mantle holes from a vantage point behind the tilma. With this set up, the crown holes will turn out to be on the head of the woman [<a href="https://www.catholiccompany.com/magazine/the-miraculous-image-of-our-lady-of-guadalupe/">Gretchen Filz</a>]. Thus, it seems she is wearing a crown of stars on her head.

Divine>God Exists>Miracles->Fatima,#DB#,Is there a miracle that happened in Fatima, Portugal on the 13th of November 1917?,#DB#,In the said date, rain pours on the people in Cova da Iria, Fatima, making them all and their surrounding wet. Few moments after the rain, the people see the sun dances in the sky. After this, their wet clothes and surrounding become dry. The energy required to evaporate all the water in their clothes and surrounding is equivalent to that of #BLseveral nuclear bombs!LB# This must-be miraculous event was published in Portugal news papers and attested as true even by the atheist witnesses [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_of_the_Sun">Wikipedia</a>].,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30
Divine>God Exists>Miracles->Shroud of Turin,#DB#,Is the Shroud of Turin, Italy, that is believed to wrap the body of the entombed Jesus Christ miraculous?,#DB#,The negative image of a naked man in the shroud is very superficial; it is only on the topmost fibrils that constitute the topmost fibres of the shroud. If paint or burning was used to create the image it will #BLgo through several layers of fibresLB# in the shroud. This proves that neither of the two was used to create the image. #LF# The image looks like a photocopy on cloth and not on paper, a technology obviously absent on the 13th century. Thus, it was theorized to be #BLformed using lightLB# called ultraviolet rays. The theory states further that, the rays were applied for a very short period of time. Thus, if the theory is true, the power to create the image will reach 34 trillion watts [<a href="https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-religion/2820363/posts">Marco Tosatti</a>], greater than the combined power generated by all electrical power plants in the world! and greater than the most powerful LASER to date that has a billion watts only [#PRRobert A.

Divine>God Exists>Miracles->Eucharistic miracles,#DB#,Are there proven true Eucharistic miracles that happened?,#DB#,Many. But only two miracles are dealt here. First, in Buenos Aires, Argentina on 1996, a consecrated host inadvertently falls to the floor, that is why it was submerged in water to dissolve. However, after several days, the host becomes flesh. On 2004, the flesh was examined by an expert in cardiac pathology and forensic medicine named Professor Frederick Zugibe of Columbia University, New York. He is an atheist and does not know that the flesh was from a consecrated host. His examination shows the flesh as a human heart tissue with white blood cells that naturally die after 20 minutes outside of a living body, but the #BLtissue is still alive after 8 yearsLB# outside a living body! Impossible! Consequently, he became Catholic [<a href="https://emmanuel.info/en/the-eucharistic-miracle-in-buenos-aires/">Ricardo Castañon Gomez</a>]. #LF# Second, in Sokolka, Poland, some particles of a consecrated host become connected living heart flesh complexly intertwined with the untransformed particles of the host. The flesh has indications of being taken from a dying man enduring extreme pain. Using an electron microscope, the separation between the intertwine is miraculously just few microns (1/1000 millimeter = 1 micron) only. This #BLcomplex intertwine cannot be recreatedLB# even with modern technology [<a href="https://www.catholicmom.com/articles/2016/05/02/eucharistic-miracle-sokolka-poland">Jane Korvemaker</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbSjuMxXX-E">Robert Spitzer</a>]. #LF# It was known that all of the flesh transubstantiated from consecrated hosts have cells with X chromosomes only, i.e., the owners of the flesh have #BLnon-human fathersLB# but have human mothers [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y48kLpUHbE0">Chris Alar</a>].

First: Sister Wilhelmina Lancaster from Missouri, USA, and foundress of the Benedictines of Mary Queen of Apostles died last 2019. Four years later of being dead and buried, her un-embalmed body was exhumed and found to be incorruptible, and her clothes did not disintegrate even though the cloth lining the inside of her ordinary wooden coffin disintegrates. As the wooden coffin rots, its cover fell, such that, the body of Sister Wilhelmina was #BLsoaked in waterLB#; however, her appearance is that of a newly died person despite being buried for four years already [<a href="https://www.churchmilitant.com/video/episode/fwbd-incorruptibles">Christine Niles</a>]. #LF# Second: Saint Marie-Bernarde Soubirous of Lourdes, France died on 1879; until now her corpse is still incorruptible and her appearance is that of a newly died person. Thirty years after she died and buried, the church hired an atheist forensic scientist to examine her corpse. When her corpse was opened, the scientist smelled no bad odour but instead of roses, her #BLinternal body organs did not deteriorateLB#, and fresh blood drips from her liver. All of these cannot be explained scientifically. There are however some incorruptible corpses (e.g., mummies) that can be explained scientifically [#PRJoan Carroll Cruz#MD#author: Joan Carroll Cruz#CR#title: The Incorruptibles: A Study of the Incorruption of the Bodies of Various Catholic Saints and Beati#CR#publisher: TAN Books#CR#year: 1977PR#].,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30
Divine>God Exists>Miracles->Christianity,#DB#,Is Christianity a miracle?,#DB#,People usually choose positive sensation-stimulating things. For example, it feels good to take revenge, discriminate other people, and not to pay ones sins committed in this life. These actions are prohibited or taught as unjust in Christianity which is therefore expected to be #BLundesirable to manyLB#. Despite this attribute, there are more Christians (approximately 31% of humans today [<a href="https://www.learnreligions.com/christianity-statistics-700533">Mary Fairchild</a>]) than each of the other faiths in the world.

Divine>God Exists>Unbelievers->Morality,#DB#,Are the New Testament principles and the Christian God#@#s existence necessary to obtain better morality than without them?,#DB#,The New Testament principles of the Christian God make the morality of people who followed them better. For example, the lives of the saints are morally extremely remarkable [#PRAlban Butler#MD#author: Alban Butler#CR#title: Lives of the Saints: with Reflections for Every Day in the Year#CR#publisher: Benziger Bros.#CR#year: 1894PR#]. In contrast, most people of atheist China nowadays are apathetic to the sufferings of their fellow humans [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfLnFVzfKBs&has_verified=1">W. F. Sterzel</a>]. Further, there were ancient non-Christian peoples who burned female widows alive, killed men and children as offering to their god, and terribly oppressed women. All of these were #BLstopped based on the New TestamentLB# principles and no other, which supports an affirmative answer to the question. Lastly, people who claim to be Christians but morally bankrupt are fake Christians based on the principles.,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30

The church believes that He is the wisdom of God the Father [#PR1 Corinthians 1:24#MD#But to those who have been called, Jews as well as Greeks, the Christ is the virtue of God and the wisdom of God.PR#], and proceeds from, but not created by, the Father. This relationship is akin to your knowledge of the world that emerges in your mind, but not created by you. With respect to the view that God the #BLFather is the originLB# of Jesus Christ, He is greater than Jesus Christ. However, even if Jesus Christ proceeds from the Father, He is divine by nature and equal to (i.e., not lesser than) the Father as everything (i.e., including all the power) the Father has is His [#PRJohn 16:15#MD#All things whatsoever that the Father has are mine.

The Greek empire was the dominion of geniuses, such as, Pythagoras, Archimedes, Aristotle, etc. who developed knowledge being taught until now in schools. The Roman empire was the most powerful among the empires in the first set, the lingua franca in it was the language of the last empire (this is why most books in the Bible were written in Greek even if they were written during the Roman empire), and eagle was its symbol. #LF# The second set is composed of the Spanish, British and American empires. Only the Spanish empire spread Christianity to great number of people, i.e., it helped God.

Divine>Blessed Trinity->Psychology,#DB#,Can the Blessed Trinity be explained using Psychology and Physics?,#DB#,There is a mental illness referred in Psychology as #BLSchizophreniaLB#, where a person with this illness has multiple personalities. For example, in one moment he has a personality of a saint, the next moment a criminal, the next moment a genius, etc. Notice that all of his personalities are different and manifested in one body only. #LF# Let us theorized that the Blessed Trinity is analogous to a Schizophrenic person with three different personalities (Father, Son and the Holy Spirit) manifested in one body only. Let us theorize further that the body is God. Knowing that all of three personalities are in one body, hence each One of them is God. #LF# Needless to say, God and heaven are eternal. Thus, the objects in heaven do not degrade, otherwise they will not be eternal. In Physics, a measure of degradation is referred to as entropy, whose positive change is related to time [#PRMichael C. Mackey#MD#author: Michael C. Mackey#CR#title: Time#@#s Arrow: The origins of thermodynamic behavior#CR#publisher: Courier Corporation#CR#year: 2011PR#]. If this physics is true in heaven, as objects there do not degrade, then the entropy there do not positively change, and thus #BLtime does not existLB# there as well. In support of this idea, the Big Bang theory implies no space and time before the beginning of the universe [#PRKaren C. Fox#MD#author: Karen C. Fox#CR#title: The big bang theory: What it is, where it came from, and why it works#CR#publisher: John Wiley \& Sons#CR#year: 2002PR#]. Thus, heaven where God resides and thus exists prior to the universe has no space and time. #LF# As there is no space and time in heaven, the three different personalities that formed the Blessed Trinity simultaneously (i.e., not one after the other) manifest in one body (as theorized above), perhaps due to the absence of space. Thus, one might witness in heaven only one God but with three simultaneous different personalities. This seem to be illogical. Remember however that the #BLlogic in heaven may not be similar to that on EarthLB# which you are using now (find and then tap the tab with keyword #SQQuantum Mechanics#SQ for further explanation on this matter).

This wayward child bought several weapons using the fortune inherited from his rich father. By the number of weapons, he killed more people than that of the bad-fathered family. Who is then better, the first or the second father? #LF# This parable is fitting to Christianity who has good lessons, such that arguably, many Christians get #BLfinancially rich and technologically advancedLB#. However, as they are just humans, not all of them are faithful to the Christian doctrines. Thus, by their wealth and technology, the destructions brought by the unfaithful Christians are greater than those of the non-Christians.

Even seven times?#DQPR#, #PRMark 8:29#MD#Then he said to them, #DQYet truly, who do you say that I am?#DQ Peter responded by saying to him, #DQYou are the Christ.#DQPR#, #PRLuke 12:41#MD#Then Peter said to him, #DQLord, are you telling this parable to us, or also to everyone?#DQPR#, #PRJohn 6:68--69#MD#Then Simon Peter answered him: #DQLord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life. And we have believed, and we recognize that you are the Christ, the Son of God.#DQPR#]; (c) as always the first in the lists of the apostles [#PRMatthew 10:1--4#MD#And having called together his twelve disciples, he gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out and to cure every sickness and every infirmity. Now the names of the twelve Apostles are these: the First, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, James of Zebedee, and John his brother, Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the tax collector, and James of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.PR#, #PRMark 3:16--19#MD#and he imposed on Simon the name Peter; and also he imposed on James of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, the name #SQBoanerges,#SQ that is, #SQSons of Thunder;#SQ and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James of Alphaeus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.PR#, #PRLuke 6:14--16#MD#Simon, whom he surnamed Peter, and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew, Matthew and Thomas, James of Alphaeus, and Simon who is called the Zealot, and Jude of James, and Judas Iscariot, who was a traitor.PR#, #PRActs 1:13#MD#And when they had entered into the cenacle, they ascended to the place where Peter and John, James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Jude of James, were staying.PR#] (the lists are in order of importance as Judas Iscariot is always the last in them); (d) being made by Christ as the pastor of His flock [#PRJohn 21:15--17#MD#Then, when they had dined, Jesus said to Simon Peter, #DQSimon, son of John, do you love me more than these?#DQ He said to him, #DQYes, Lord, you know that I love you.#DQ He said to him, #DQFeed my lambs.#DQ He said to him again: #DQSimon, son of John, do you love me?#DQ He said to him, #DQYes, Lord, you know that I love you.#DQ He said to him, #DQFeed my lambs.#DQ He said to him a third time, #DQSimon, son of John, do you love me?#DQ Peter was very grieved that he had asked him a third time, #DQDo you love me?#DQ And so he said to him: #DQLord, you know all things. You know that I love you.#DQ He said to him, #DQFeed my sheep.PR#]; (a) as the first to have seen the risen Christ [#PRLuke 24:34#MD#saying: #DQIn truth, the Lord has risen, and he has appeared to Simon.#DQPR#]; (f) as having more authority than the other apostles [#PRActs 1:13--26#MD#And when they had entered into the cenacle, they ascended to the place where Peter and John, James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Jude of James, were staying. All these were persevering with one accord in prayer with the women, and with Mary, the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers. In those days, Peter, rising up in the midst of the brothers, said (now the crowd of men altogether was about one hundred and twenty): #DQNoble brothers, the Scripture must be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit predicted by the mouth of David about Judas, who was the leader of those who apprehended Jesus. He had been numbered among us, and he was chosen by lot for this ministry. And this man certainly possessed an estate from the wages of iniquity, and so, having been hanged, he burst open in the middle and all his internal organs poured out. And this became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that this field was called in their language, Akeldama, that is, #SQField of Blood.#SQ For it has been written in the book of Psalms: #SQLet their dwelling place be desolate and may there be no one who dwells within it,#SQ and #SQLet another take his episcopate.#SQ Therefore, it is necessary that, out of these men who have been assembling with us throughout the entire time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, beginning from the baptism of John, until the day when he was taken up from us, one of these be made a witness with us of his Resurrection.#DQ And they appointed two: Joseph, who was called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And praying, they said: #DQMay you, O Lord, who knows the heart of everyone, reveal which one of these two you have chosen, to take a place in this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas prevaricated, so that he might go to his own place.#DQ And they cast lots concerning them, and the lot fell upon Matthias. And he was numbered with the eleven Apostles.PR#, #PRActs 2:41#MD#Therefore, those who accepted his discourse were baptized. And about three thousand souls were added on that day.PR#, #PRActs 5:1--11#MD#But a certain man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a field, and he was deceitful about the price of the field, with his wife#SQs consent. And bringing only part of it, he placed it at the feet of the Apostles. But Peter said: #DQAnanias, why has Satan tempted your heart, so that you would lie to the Holy Spirit and be deceitful about the price of the land? Did it not belong to you while you retained it? And having sold it, was it not in your power? Why have you set this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God!#DQ Then Ananias, upon hearing these words, fell down and expired. And a great fear overwhelmed all who heard of it. And the young men rose up and removed him; and carrying him out, they buried him. Then about the space of three hours passed, and his wife entered, not knowing what had happened. And Peter said to her, #DQTell me, woman, if you sold the field for this amount?#DQ And she said, #DQYes, for that amount.#DQ And Peter said to her: #DQWhy have you agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they shall carry you out!#DQ Immediately, she fell down before his feet and expired. Then the young men entered and found her dead. And they carried her out and buried her next to her husband. And a great fear came over the entire Church and over all who heard these things.PR#, #PRActs 8:18--23#MD#But when Simon had seen that, by the imposition of the hands of the Apostles, the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money, saying, #DQGive this power to me also, so that on whomever I will lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.#DQ But Peter said to him: #DQLet your money be with you in perdition, for you have supposed that a gift of God might be possessed by money. There is no part or place for you in this matter. For your heart is not upright in the sight of God. And so, repent from this, your wickedness, and beg God, so that perhaps this plan of your heart might be forgiven you. For I perceive you to be in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.#DQPR#], e.g., being the first to decide on a dogma [#PRActs 15:7--11#MD#And after a great contention had taken place, Peter rose up and said to them: #DQNoble brothers, you know that, in recent days, God has chosen from among us, by my mouth, Gentiles to hear the word of the Gospel and to believe. And God, who knows hearts, offered testimony, by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just as to us. And he distinguished nothing between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. Now therefore, why do you tempt God to impose a yoke upon the necks of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear? But by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we believe in order to be saved, in the same manner also as them.#DQPR#]). And many more [#PRActs 2:14--40#MD#But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and he spoke to them: #DQMen of Judea, and all those who are staying in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and incline your ears to my words. For these men are not inebriated, as you suppose, for it is the third hour of the day. But this is what was spoken of by the prophet Joel: #SQAnd this shall be: in the last days, says the Lord, I will pour out, from my Spirit, upon all flesh. And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy. And your youths shall see visions, and your elders shall dream dreams. And certainly, upon my men and women servants in those days, I will pour out from my Spirit, and they shall prophesy. And I will bestow wonders in heaven above, and signs on earth below: blood and fire and the vapor of smoke. The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood, before the great and manifest day of the Lord arrives. And this shall be: whoever shall invoke the name of the Lord will be saved.#SQ Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus the Nazarene is a man confirmed by God among you through the miracles and wonders and signs that God accomplished through him in your midst, just as you also know. This man, under the definitive plan and foreknowledge of God, was delivered by the hands of the unjust, afflicted, and put to death. And he whom God has raised up has broken the sorrows of Hell, for certainly it was impossible for him to be held by it. For David said about him: #SQI foresaw the Lord always in my sight, for he is at my right hand, so that I may not be moved. Because of this, my heart has rejoiced, and my tongue has exulted. Moreover, my flesh shall also rest in hope. For you will not abandon my soul to Hell, nor will you allow your Holy One to see corruption. You have made known to me the ways of life. You will completely fill me with happiness by your presence.#SQ Noble brothers, permit me to speak freely to you about the Patriarch David: for he passed away and was buried, and his sepulcher is with us, even to this very day. Therefore, he was a prophet, for he knew that God had sworn an oath to him about the fruit of his loins, about the One who would sit upon his throne. Foreseeing this, he was speaking about the Resurrection of the Christ. For he was neither left behind in Hell, nor did his flesh see corruption. This Jesus, God raised up again, and of this we are all witnesses. Therefore, being exalted to the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the Promise of the Holy Spirit, he poured this out, just as you now see and hear. For David did not ascend into heaven. But he himself said: #SQThe Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.#SQ Therefore, may the entire house of Israel know most certainly that God has made this same Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.#DQ Now when they had heard these things, they were contrite in heart, and they said to Peter and to the other Apostles: #DQWhat should we do, noble brothers?#DQ Yet truly, Peter said to them: #DQDo penance; and be baptized, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of your sins. And you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the Promise is for you and for your sons, and for all who are far away: for whomever the Lord our God will have called.#DQ And then, with very many other words, he testified and he exhorted them, saying, #DQSave yourselves from this depraved generation.#DQPR#, #PRActs 3:6--7#MD#But Peter said: #DQSilver and gold is not mine. But what I have, I give to you. In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, rise up and walk.#DQ And taking him by the right hand, he lifted him up. And immediately his legs and feet were strengthened.PR#, #PRLuke 22:32#MD#But I have prayed for you, so that your faith may not fail, and so that you, once converted, may confirm your brothers.#DQPR#]. Thus, the Anglican scholar J.N.D Kelly said that St. Peter is #BLthe undisputed leaderLB# of the apostles [<a href="https://www.catholic.com/magazine/print-edition/defending-the-papacy">Trent Horn</a>]. #LF# #PT#NBSt. James and not St. Peter led the council in Jerusalem related inTP# [#PRActs 15:13--21#MD#And after they had been silent, James responded by saying: #DQNoble brothers, listen to me. Simon has explained in what manner God first visited, so as to take from the Gentiles a people to his name. And the words of the Prophets are in agreement with this, just as it was written: #SQAfter these things, I will return, and I will rebuild the tabernacle of David, which has fallen down. And I will rebuild its ruins, and I will raise it up, so that the rest of men may seek the Lord, along with all the nations over whom my name has been invoked, says the Lord, who does these things.#SQ To the Lord, his own work has been known from eternity. Because of this, I judge that those who were converted to God from among the Gentiles are not to be disturbed, but instead that we write to them, that they should keep themselves from the defilement of idols, and from fornication, and from whatever has been suffocated, and from blood. For Moses, from ancient times, has had in each city those who preach him in the synagogues, where he is read on every Sabbath.#DQPR#]. #CT#NBIn this council, St. Peter was the first to speak and the one to solve the dietary problem by giving a doctrine from God TC#[#PRActs 15:7--11#MD#And after a great contention had taken place, Peter rose up and said to them: #DQNoble brothers, you know that, in recent days, God has chosen from among us, by my mouth, Gentiles to hear the word of the Gospel and to believe.

But by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we believe in order to be saved, in the same manner also as them.#DQPR#]#CT#NB. On the other hand, St. James agreed to the decision of St. Peter and added that the Jews and gentiles be united, this is a TC##CBpastoral preachingBC##CT#NB and not doctrinal.

Authority>Authorized Peter->Early,#DB#,The bishop of Rome has no authority over the early church.,#DB#,Certainly he has, for example: (a) the fourth pope of the first century Clement of Rome manifested his authority by warning the church in Corinth (not a church in Rome) that those who violate his spiritual commands have sinned and are in grave spiritual danger; (b) St. Ignatius of Antioch (110 AD) said that the church of Rome is the teacher of other churches and the leader in loving them; (c) and the letters of Popes Clement (92#DS99 AD) and Soter (167#DS174 AD) were read in the early churches as the scriptures were [<a href="https://www.catholic.com/magazine/print-edition/defending-the-papacy">Trent Horn</a>].,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30
Authority>Authorized Peter->Elder,#DB#,St. Peter simply addressed himself as elder and not pope in [1 Peter 5:1].,#DB#,St. Peter desired his followers to be humble [#PR1 Peter 5:5#MD#Similarly, young persons, be subject to the elders. And infuse all humility among one another, for God resists the arrogant, but to the humble he gives grace.PR#]. Thus, as an example, he did not expressed his papal status. Even St. Paul called himself as a deacon only [#PR1 Corinthians 3:5#MD#We are only the ministers of him in whom you have believed, just as the Lord has granted to each of you.PR#, #PR2 Corinthians 11:23#MD#They are the ministers of Christ (I speak as if I were less wise); more so am I: with many more labors, with numerous imprisonments, with wounds beyond measure, with frequent mortifications.PR#] and the least of all the saints [#PREphesians 3:8#MD#Although I am the least of all the saints, I have been given this grace: to evangelize among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,PR#]. Thus, the #BLhumble addressLB# of St. Peter to himself did not invalidated his status as the first disciple [<a href="https://www.catholic.com/magazine/print-edition/defending-the-papacy">Trent Horn</a>].,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30
Authority>Authorized Peter->Rome,#DB#,St. Peter was never in Rome, i.e., he never been a pope in Rome.,#DB#,The Babylonian empire was oppressive to the people of God; similar to the Roman empire. Thus, it was made as a #BLcode word for RomeLB#. St. Peter had been to Rome as he wrote that he is writing from Babylon [#PR1 Peter 5:13#MD#The Church which is in Babylon, elect together with you, greets you, as does my son, Mark.PR#]. #LF# St. Peter was not always in Rome, he might be absent there when the Pauline epistle to Rome was written, such that, he was not mentioned in it. However, many #BLearly ChristiansLB# implied that St. Peter was in Rome as he was: (a) implied by St. Eusebius to be martyred in Rome in the year 54 AD; (b) and reported by St. Ignatius of Antioch (110 AD) to the Christians of Rome as one of founders of the church of Rome and the one who transferred the leadership of the church of Rome to Linus [<a href="https://www.catholic.com/magazine/print-edition/defending-the-papacy">Trent Horn</a>].,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30
Authority>Authorized Peter->Emperor,#DB#,The Roman emperor created the papacy on the fourth century.,#DB#,Prior to the fourth century, there were popes already. For example, prior to the legalization of Christianity on 190 AD, Pope St. Victor I excommunicated a part of the church due to its refusal to celebrate Easter at proper day. The excommunication was accomplished, simply because the pope said so, even if it is viewed as inappropriate by some high ranking church officials, e.g., St. Irenaeus [<a href="https://www.catholic.com/magazine/print-edition/defending-the-papacy">Trent Horn</a>]. Therefore, even prior to the legalization of Christianity (on the fourth century) in the Roman empire, there were popes already, such that the papacy was not created by a Roman emperor in the fourth century.,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30
Authority>Authorized Peter->Important,#DB#,Why did Jesus Christ not mention St. Peter and his successors to have especial authority when the apostles were arguing on who among them is the most important [Luke 22:24]?,#DB#,[#PRLuke 22:24#MD#Now there was also a contention among them, as to which of them seemed to be the greater.PR#] shows that Jesus Christ did not make any one proud, that is why He did not mention who is the most important among His apostles. Rather, He pointed out that one of them would be the greatest ruler but a humble servant [#PRLuke 22:26#MD#But it must not be so with you. Instead, whoever is greater among you, let him become the lesser. And whoever is the leader, let him become the server.PR#]. Inspired by this statement, each pope since the sixth century has the title #SQthe servant of the servants of God#SQ [<a href="https://www.catholic.com/magazine/print-edition/defending-the-papacy">Trent Horn</a>].,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30
Authority>Authorized Peter->Successor,#DB#,There is no proof that the ministry of St. Peter has successors.,#DB#,Consider the following: (a) The rock is a symbol of eternity and made as name of St. Peter [#PRMatthew 16:18#MD#And I say to you, that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it.PR#]; (b) St. Peter holds the keys (or steward) of the eternal kingdom of God [#PRMatthew 16:19#MD#And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. And whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound, even in heaven. And whatever you shall release on earth shall be released, even in heaven.#DQPR#]; (c) and, the true pastor of the church is Jesus Christ. His ministry is eternal and He delegated this to St. Peter [#PRJohn 21:15--17#MD#Then, when they had dined, Jesus said to Simon Peter, #DQSimon, son of John, do you love me more than these?#DQ He said to him, #DQYes, Lord, you know that I love you.#DQ He said to him, #DQFeed my lambs.#DQ He said to him again: #DQSimon, son of John, do you love me?#DQ He said to him, #DQYes, Lord, you know that I love you.#DQ He said to him, #DQFeed my lambs.#DQ He said to him a third time, #DQSimon, son of John, do you love me?#DQ Peter was very grieved that he had asked him a third time, #DQDo you love me?#DQ And so he said to him: #DQLord, you know all things. You know that I love you.#DQ He said to him, #DQFeed my sheep.PR#]. All of the above mean that being the rock, the steward of God#@#s kingdom, and the given #BLpastoral duty are also eternalLB# ministries of St. Peter. Thus, the latter has successors for the ministries to be eternal [<a href="https://www.catholic.com/magazine/print-edition/defending-the-papacy">Trent Horn</a>]. #LF# Even though not in the Bible, it is good to know that Pope Clement of Rome, at the end of the first century, commanded that after the pope dies there should be a person elected to succeed his ministry.

Authority>Authorized Peter->Beast,#DB#,The pope is the beast mentioned in the book of Revelation [Revelation 17:9].,#DB#,No pope denied Jesus as the Christ; thus he is not the anti-Christ cited in [#PR1 John 2:22#MD#Who is a liar, other than he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This one is the Antichrist, who denies the Father and the Son.PR#]. The Vatican hill is not part of seven hills; thus, it is not the seat of the beast mentioned in [#PRRevelation 17:9#MD#And this is for one who understands, who has wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains, upon which the woman sits, and they are seven kings.PR#]. Also mentioned in the latter verse that the number 666 corresponds to the name of the beast. It also corresponds to the Latin phrase #SQVicarius Filii Dei#SQ, or vicar of the son of God. However, the #BLphrase is not one of the titlesLB# of the Pope. Thus, the pope is not the beast mentioned in the book of Revelation. #LF# There are many names that can correspond to the number 666; such as the Latin of Ellen Gould White who founded the Seventh-day Adventists church, and of emperor Nero [<a href="https://www.catholic.com/magazine/print-edition/defending-the-papacy">Trent Horn</a>].,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30

Meaning, #BLmalign spiritual powers will never winLB# if they attack the church, attack such as dragging the church to proclaim wrong Christian doctrines. As the pope is the prime teacher of the church, he cannot teach even a single wrong Christian doctrine [<a href="https://www.catholic.com/magazine/print-edition/defending-the-papacy">Trent Horn</a>].

For before certain ones arrived from James, he ate with the Gentiles. But when they had arrived, he drew apart and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision. And the other Jews consented to his pretense, so that even Barnabas was led by them into that falseness. But when I had seen that they were not walking correctly, by the truth of the Gospel, I said to Cephas in front of everyone: #DQIf you, while you are a Jew, are living like the Gentiles and not the Jews, how is it that you compel the Gentiles to keep the customs of the Jews?#DQPR#], St. Peter was not reprimanded by St. Paul on matters of faith, rather on his attitude towards the gentiles [<a href="https://www.catholic.com/magazine/print-edition/defending-the-papacy">Trent Horn</a>].,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30

Considering [#PRMatthew 23:9#MD#And do not choose to call anyone on earth your father.

On the #BLparticipation in the fatherhoodLB#, the priests establish the fatherhood of the Father [<a href="https://www.catholic.com/video/understanding-call-no-man-father">Jimmy Akin</a>]. #LF# The concept of fatherhood in the Bible does not refer only to the father of a family and God. It also refers to respected people or anyone who have especial relationship with the caller.

This portico was known to have had a wall that blocked the cold winter east winds. Thus, it makes sense for Jesus Christ to walk on this portico to keep warm, and thus supports the veracity of the verse. Another one: [#PRMark 14:51--52#MD#Now a certain young man followed him, having nothing but a fine linen cloth over himself. And they took hold of him. But he, rejecting the fine linen cloth, escaped from them naked.PR#] describes the scene when Christ was captured in Gethsemane. In this event, there is a young man wearing nothing but a linen to cover his body. His clothing was removed when grabbed by the guards that he ran away naked. This manner of clothing was a sacrificial practice of the Essenes, thereby approximately establishing the period enclosing the event, and hence the time of Christ also.

Now, #BLwhich hermeneutics would you acceptLB#, the ones based on traditions and writings of the apostles or the one based only on the latter? #LF# The writers of the New testaments are not brilliant scholars; most of the apostles were just fishermen.

However, before they passed away, it is to be expected that many Christians received clear explanations from them on their writings that became part of the New Testament. There are several #BLapostolic CatholicsLB# (had acquaintances with the apostles), such as, St. Ignatius of Antioch 35#DS110 AD who had been the auditor of St. John the apostle, St. Clement of Rome 35#DS99 AD who engaged with St. Peter and St. Paul, and St. Polycarp of Smyrna 69#DS155 AD and Papias of Hierapolis 60#DS130 AD known by St. John the apostle [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostolic_Fathers">Wikipedia</a>].

The God of the people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people, when they were settlers in the land of Egypt. And with an exalted arm, he led them away from there. And throughout a time of forty years, he endured their behavior in the desert. And by destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan, he divided their land among them by lot, after about four hundred and fifty years. And after these things, he gave them judges, even until the prophet Samuel. And later on, they petitioned for a king. And God gave them Saul, the son of Kish, a man from the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. And having removed him, he raised up for them king David. And offering testimony about him, he said, #SQI have found David, the son of Jesse, to be a man according to my own heart, who will accomplish all that I will.#SQ From his offspring, according to the Promise, God has brought Jesus the Savior to Israel. John was preaching, before the face of his advent, a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. Then, when John completed his course, he was saying: #SQI am not the one you consider me to be. For behold, one arrives after me, the shoes of whose feet I am not worthy to loosen.#SQ Noble brothers, sons of the stock of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, it is to you the Word of this salvation has been sent. For those who were living in Jerusalem, and its rulers, heeding neither him, nor the voices of the Prophets that are read on every Sabbath, fulfilled these by judging him. And although they found no case for death against him, they petitioned Pilate, so that they might put him to death. And when they had fulfilled everything that had been written about him, taking him down from the tree, they placed him in a tomb. Yet truly, God raised him up from the dead on the third day. And he was seen for many days by those who went up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who even now are his witnesses to the people. And we are announcing to you that the Promise, which was made to our fathers, has been fulfilled by God for our children by raising up Jesus, just as it has been written in the second Psalm also: #SQYou are my Son.

Yet truly, he whom God has raised from the dead has not seen corruption. Therefore, let it be known to you, noble brothers, that through him is announced to you remission from sins and from everything by which you were not able to be justified in the law of Moses. In him, all who believe are justified. Therefore, be careful, lest what was said by the Prophets may overwhelm you: #SQYou despisers! Look, and wonder, and be scattered!

However, He did not prohibited the use of engraved images (such as that of the virgin Mary and the saints) as #BLreflection of the heavenly worldLB#. For instance, He commanded Moses to create statues of cherubim that were then placed on top of the Ark of the covenant [#PRExodus 25:18--20#MD#Likewise, you shall make two Cherubim of formed gold, on both sides of the oracle. Let one Cherub be on the one side, and the other be on the other. And let them cover both sides of the propitiatory, spreading their wings and covering the oracle, and let them look out toward one another, their faces being turned toward the propitiatory, with which the ark is to be covered,PR#]. Similar commands are expressed in [#PREzekiel 41:17--22#MD#and it reached even to the inner house, and to the exterior, throughout the entire wall, all around the interior and exterior, for the entire extent. And there were cherubim and palm trees wrought, and each palm tree was between one cherub and another, and every cherub had two faces. The face of a man was closest to the palm tree on one side, and the face of a lion was closest to the palm tree on the other side. This was depicted throughout the entire house all around. From the floor, even to the upper parts of the gate, there were cherubim and palm trees engraved in the wall of the temple. The square threshold and the face of the sanctuary were one sight facing the other. The altar of wood was three cubits in height, and its length was two cubits. And its corners, and its length, and its walls were of wood. And he said to me, #DQThis is the table in the sight of the Lord.#DQPR#, #PRExodus 21:6--9#MD#then his lord shall make an offering for him to the heavens, and it shall be applied to the door and the posts, and he will pierce his ear with an awl. And he shall be his servant in perpetuity. If anyone sells his daughter to be a servant, she shall not depart as a female servant is accustomed to go out. If she displeases the eyes of her lord, to whom she had been delivered, he shall dismiss her. But he shall have no authority to sell her to a foreign people, even if he despises her. But if he has betrothed her to his son, he shall treat her according to the custom with daughters.PR#, #PRNumbers 21:6--9#MD#For this reason, the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, which wounded or killed many of them.

When those who had been struck gazed upon it, they were healed.PR#, #PR1 Kings 6:23--28#MD#And he made in the oracle two cherubim from wood of the olive tree, of ten cubits in height. One wing of a cherub was five cubits, and the other wing of a cherub was five cubits, that is, having ten cubits from the summit of one wing even to the summit of the other wing. Likewise, the second cherub was ten cubits. And the measure was equal and the work was one, in the two cherubim, that is, one cherub had a height of ten cubits, and similarly the second cherub. And he stationed the cherubim in the middle of the inner temple. And the cherubim extended their wings, and the wing of the one was touching the wall, and the wing of the second cherub was touching the other wall. But the other wings, in the middle of the temple, were touching each another. He also overlaid the cherubim with gold.PR#, #PR1 Kings 7:23--39#MD#He also made a molten sea, of ten cubits from brim to brim, rounded on all sides. Its height was five cubits, and a thin rope of thirty cubits wrapped it all around. And a sculpted work under the brim encircled it for ten cubits going around the sea. There were two rows cast of striated sculptures. And it was standing upon twelve oxen, of which three were looking toward the north, and three toward the west, and three toward the south, and three toward the east. And the sea above was over them. And their posteriors were entirely hidden within. And the basin was the thickness of three twelfths. And its brim was like the brim of a chalice, or like the outturned petal of a lily. It contained two thousand baths. And he made ten bases of brass: each base was four cubits in length, and four cubits in width, and three cubits in height. And the work itself of the bases was engraved; and there were sculptures between the junctures. And between the little crowns and the edges, there were lions, and oxen, and cherubim; and similarly in the junctures above. And under the lions and oxen were something like bands of brass hanging down. And each base had four wheels, with axels of brass. And at the four sides were something like little arms, under the cast basin, facing away from one another. Also, the mouth of the interior of the basin was at the top of the head. And what was visible outside was of one cubit all around, and altogether it had one cubit and a half. Now at the corners of the columns were diverse engravings. And the spaces between the columns were square, not round. And the four wheels, which were at the four corners of the base, were joined to one another under the base. The height of one wheel held one cubit and a half. Now these were the kind of wheels such as are often made for a chariot. And their axels, and spokes, and tires, and centers were all cast. And the four little arms, which were at each corner of a base, were cast and joined together as part of the base itself. And at the summit of the base, there was a round stand of one half cubit, fabricated so that the basin could be placed upon it, having its engravings, and various sculptures of its own. He also engraved those plates, which were of brass. And at the corners were cherubim, and lions, and palm trees, standing out, as if in the likeness of a man, so that they seemed not to be engraved, but placed adjacent on all sides. In this manner, he made ten bases with the same casting and measure, and very similar engravings. He also made ten hand basins of brass. One hand basin contained four baths, and was of four cubits. And each basin he set upon a base, which is ten bases. And he stationed the ten bases, five to the right side of the temple, and five to the left. And the sea he placed to the right side of the temple, opposite the east, toward the south.PR#] [<a href="https://www.catholic.com/qa/how-can-the-church-allow-statues-when-exodus-20-forbids-it">Catholic Answers</a>].

Everyone blessed the intervention of the Lord, the just Judge who brings to light the most secret deeds; and they prayed to the Lord to completely pardon the sin of their dead companions. The valiant Judas urged his men to shun such sin in the future, for they had just seen with their own eyes what had happened to those who sinned. He took up a collection among his soldiers which amounted to two thousand pieces of silver and sent it to Jerusalem to be offered there as a sacrifice for sin. If they did not believe that their fallen companions would rise again, then it would have been a useless and foolish thing to pray for them. But they firmly believed in a splendid reward for those who died as believers; therefore, their concern was holy and in keeping with faith. This was the reason why Judas had this sacrifice offered for the dead - so that the dead might be pardoned for their sin.PR#]. The fallen warriors are not in heaven as they still have sins.

(b) [#PRMatthew 5:25--26#MD#Be reconciled with your adversary quickly, while you are still on the way with him, lest perhaps the adversary may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you will be thrown in prison. Amen I say to you, that you shall not go forth from there, until you have repaid the last quarter.PR#] is a parable that describes the suffering in the after life to pay for minor sins signified by penny or #SQkodrantes#SQ in Greek. There is no suffering in heaven, and no forgiveness in hell. (c) Cited in [#PRMatthew 12:32#MD#And anyone who will have spoken a word against the Son of man shall be forgiven.

The last phrase need not be mentioned by Jesus Christ if there is no sin that can be forgiven in the age to come (after life). Meaning, there are sins of a person that can be forgiven after death. This person cannot wait in hell as there is no forgiveness there. Also, he/she cannot enter heaven right after death as he/she has still sins. (d) In [#PR1 Corinthians 3:14--15#MD#If anyone#SQs work, which he has built upon it, remains, then he will receive a reward. If anyone#SQs work is burned up, he will suffer its loss, but he himself will still be saved, but only as through fire.PR#], the burnt works of man signify by his sins, i.e., he cannot enter heaven right after death as he still has sins that need to be cleansed [#PRRevelation 21:27#MD#There shall not enter into it anything defiled, nor anything causing an abomination, nor anything false, but only those who have been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb.PR#, #PRHabakkuk 1:13#MD#Your eyes are pure, you do not behold evil, and you cannot look towards iniquity.

(e) The physically dead Christ preached to the imprisoned souls who did not believed God in the time of Noah [#PR1 Peter 3:19#MD#And in the Spirit, he preached to those who were in prison, going to those soulsPR#]. St. Peter use the Greek word #SQphulake#SQ for prison that means #SQholding place#SQ. This place is not hell for God never visits there. It is neither heaven as the souls are imprisoned. #LF# The 5 points mentioned above imply that there must be a place that is #BLneither hell nor heavenLB# where there is no salvation nor suffering, respectively.

The #BLprohibition is in accord with the moral standard of the CatholicLB# church.

Thus, it is extremely challenging to repeal the US constitution to legalize the prohibitions. #LF# Now, deeds similar to the aforementioned immoral acts are proven in history to accelerate the collapse of the nation where they are rampant (to justify this, find and tap the tab with keyword #SQCollapse of the Roman Empire#SQ). In the collapse, the citizens are likely to be raped, murdered, or persecuted by their foreign or domestic enemies. If weighted, the fruits of practising the immoral deeds could be more painful than otherwise. Thus, which will the citizens choose, the sacrifice of not acting those deeds or the #BLterrible pain from the collapseLB#? Needless to answer, but there are problems in legalizing the prohibition as aforementioned. #LF# The remedy of the problems is to #BLmake every citizen of all nations serious CatholicsLB#, thereby they will easily abide by the prohibitions, otherwise, they will just rebel, and nothing will happen to the prohibitions. Therefore, there is a need to propagate the Catholic faith, where you can help. Go, and share this app to everyone.,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30
Society>Proposed Government Form->Enlightenment,#DB#,Are the Enlightenment principles good for a nation that abides by them?,#DB#,One Enlightenment principle is the separation of church and state, such that, the laws created by the latter are not guided by the former. It is expected that the state will create laws based only on the taste of its lawmakers and political voters due to their being human. Considering most #BLcitizens wanted pleasureLB#, the created laws will likely contradict church doctrines (e.g., divorce, pornography, same-sex marriage and abortion) that cause danger and immorality in society (to justify this, find and tap every tab with keyword #SQDanger of divorce#SQ, #SQDanger of abortion#SQ,#SQPornography#SQ, #SQDetriments from homosexuality#SQ, or #SQBenefits of Catholicism#SQ). By this, even if the corrupt government officials are replaced through elections, their #BLreplacements are expected to be corruptLB# also, or the elections will be rigged. Thus, it can be argued that whatever political or administrative strategies are put into law, the national problems under the Enlightenment will likely not be resolved as the people tasked to implement them will be immoral by Catholic standards. For instance, a group of mafiosos paid some judges to absolve one of theirs, that impeded Mayor Rudy Giuliani to quickly eliminate New York city crimes. Therefore, the Enlightenment principles are not good for any nation.#LF# Some would say that Europe progressed after the adoption of the Enlightenment principles, however they did not realised that the good European morals #BLshaped by the churchLB# are the significant factors of their progress.

On the other hand, the US constitution, aside from promoting democracy, is also based on faith used to create morality-related laws. But which faith needs to be its foundation?

Not stated but, more likely, the US constitution is based on #BLprotestantismLB# which is the faith of most of its creator. This assertion is supported by the creation, using the constitution, of the morality-related laws agreed upon by the protestants, e.g. divorce, pornography, same-sex marriage and abortion. The US constitution is also based on the #BLEnlightenmentLB# principles that demand the separation of church and state, thereby some of its morality-related derivative laws are immoral (in Catholic view), such as the immoral protestant-approved laws.
