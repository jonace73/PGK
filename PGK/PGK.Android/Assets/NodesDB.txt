Divine>God Exists->Philosophy,#DB#,Can God#@#s existence be proven using Philosophy?,#DB#, ,#DB#,0,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30
Divine>God Exists>Philosophy->Proof,#DB#,There is no proof that God exists.,#DB#,In Mathematics, axioms are accepted as true without proof, an acceptance not viewed as illogical by all mathematicians. Thus, if the axiom is not illogical then so is belief (acceptance of something being true without proof), such as in God.,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30
Divine>God Exists>Philosophy->Suffering,#DB#,There exists no loving God since many humans suffered terribly.,#DB#,Every axiom in the set of axioms is not allowed to contradict any other axioms in the set. For example, the belief in the existence of a loving God contradicts the fact that many humans experienced terrible sufferings and hardships. #LF# If every man does not feel pain (just pleasure) he would not know which thing leads to pain and which one does not. He might be eaten by an animal, and yet he will not feel pain, and his love ones will not miss him. Thus, pain is necessary for humans to more likely avoid unnatural death. #LF# There is a saying that necessity is the mother of invention. Look at the birds, they do not have difficulty in travelling from one place to another, so they do not need to create an airplane. On the other hand, humans can not fly, swim like a fish, and run like a horse. Thus, to reduce tiredness (a type of pain) in travelling, they invented airplanes, ships, etc. In short, pain motivates us to become inventive, i.e., intelligent. Becoming intelligent is a form of growth, and the will to make a person grow is referred to as love. Thus, the said pain is a form of love. #LF# If there are no people in terrible hardship, we do not need to love one another. No one knows how the character to love and intelligence emerged in our brain [<a href="https://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2020/05/11/neurologist-the-brain-is-complicated-largely-unknown/">Paul Costello</a>]. Thus, no one knows if pain is necessary for those abilities to emerge. However, the above-mentioned reasons are strong to support that pain is a factor in the emergence. Thus, pain can be a form of God#@#s love that could possibly make us intelligent and loving to others. A sort of love akin to that of a father who forced his lazy son to be hardworking (a form of growth) even if the son dislikes (a form of pain) it. Thus, the existence of pain in this world does not contradict the idea of a loving God.,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30
Divine>God Exists>Philosophy->Tragedy,#DB#,There is no loving God as He did not prevented accidents or calamities.,#DB#,Suppose someone throws a rock to kill his enemy. If God will prevent the rock to hit the enemy, how can humans learn the physics of thrown objects? If there is no physics, we can not create rockets, airplanes, etc. as all of these are based on Physics. In addition, how humans can predict the actions of things if these actions are disturbed by God? The predictability of the actions gives confidence to scientists to work on Science which yields a myriad of good things (e.g., medicine, convenience, and entertainment) and shows human more intelligent than animals. Thus, for humans to become intelligent, God did not interfere on the Physics of things, i.e., including accidents and calamities. Becoming intelligent is a form of growth, and the will to make a person grow is referred to as love.Thus, the said non-interference is a form of God#@#s love.,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30
Divine>God Exists>Philosophy->First Cause,#DB#,The concept of the First Cause developed by St. Thomas Aquinas does not prove God#@#s existence.,#DB#,St. Thomas Aquinas developed the idea referred to as, the First Cause [#PRAnthony Kenny#MD#author: Anthony Kenny#CR#title: Studies in Ethics and the Philosophy of Religion. The Five Ways: St Thomas Aquinas#@# Proofs of God#@#s Existence#CR#publisher: eBook#CR#year: 2013PR#]. What is this? Suppose you ask what causes the coconut to fall. The answer is, the Earth#@#s gravity pulls the coconut. Let us label this cause as C1. Suppose you ask further, what causes gravity? The answer is, the curvature of space-time [#PRJonathan Allday#MD#author: Jonathan Allday#CR#title: Space-time An Introduction to Einstein#@#s Theory of Gravity#CR#publisher: CRC Press#CR#year: 2019PR#]. Let us label this cause as C2. Suppose you ask and find an answer 98 tines further; Let the last cause be labelled as C100. #LF# Now, if you ask for the cause of C100 but can not find an answer (cause C101), you cannot find the ultimate cause C100. And if you can not find the cause of C100 you can not find the ultimate cause of C99. If this approach is reapplied you cannot find the ultimate cause of C1, i.e., the ultimate cause why the coconut falls. #LF# If you will not stop looking for the causes, you will reach C1 which can never be found because that is already at infinity. Thus, if you will not stop, you can never find the ultimate cause of C1. To find the ultimate cause of C1, you need to stop looking for the cause of say C700 and accept that there is no cause for this, i.e., there is no cause C701. Thus, you need to accept that there is a cause (e.g., God) that is not caused for you to find the ultimate, say, of the universe. The uncaused cause (or the First Cause) is defined as God (by St. Thomas Aquinas) who is the cause of everything, including the universe. This is the proof that God must exist, otherwise there will be no ultimate cause of everything observed. #LF# However, some physicists said, the universe just pops to existence without any cause as described in Quantum Mechanics [#PRAndrei Linde#MD#author: Andrei Linde#CR#title: Stochastic approach to tunneling and baby universe formation#CR#journal: Nuclear Physics B#CR#volume: 372#CR#pages: 421--442#CR#year: 1992PR#]. They mean, there is no God who created the universe. Now, Quantum Mechanics has several questionable fundamental principles (e.g., the measurement problem [#PRMuller, F.#MD#author: Muller, F.#CR#title: Non-Reflexive Logics, Non-Individuals and the Philosophy of QuantumMechanics#CR#journal: Nuclear Physics B#CR#publisher: Springer-Verlag#CR#year: 2023PR#]), such that, it can be false or illogical that the universe is uncaused. On the other hand, the principle of First Cause of St. Aquinas is logical; thus, this is a better proof of how the the universe comes to exist, i.e., through the First Cause who is God.,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30
Divine>God Exists>Philosophy->Reason alone,#DB#,Only reason must be used and not faith.,#DB#,In the movie #SQThe Matrix#SQ [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix">Wachowskis</a>], there are humans each lying inside a tube and has an electronic device stuck in his/her head that makes him/her aware, not of reality, but of a simulated world. Thus, the reasons in their mind have no relation to reality. We really do not know what reality is; we know only what our mind perceives which is not necessarily reality (e.g., in the movie). Thus, reasons are founded on faith that they are related to reality [#PRMarie, Dom Antoine#MD#author: Marie, Dom Antoine#CR#title: GK Chesterton#CR#journal: The Chesterton Review#CR#volume: 43#CR#number: 1/2#CR#pages: 288--296#CR#year: 2017PR#, <a href="https://www.catholic.com/audio/sp/how-science-proves-gods-existence">Joe Heschmeyer</a>].,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30

As its nature is unknown and cannot be examined by Science [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaZbCctlll4">Jeffrey Kaplan</a>] (for being subjective), no one can deny its possible subsistence beyond human death, i.e., there could be life after death. Thus, there could also be a God who might judge your sins. If you deny God#@#s existence (which is a sin) and He does not exist, nobody will judge your sins, and you will not suffer after death. However, if God does exist, you will suffer terribly after death. Thus, even if God#@#s existence is not proven, it is better to believe His existence, you will lose nothing.

Divine>God Exists>Philosophy->Cruel God,#DB#,The God in the Bible is unjustifiably cruel, such that, it is unbelievable He exists.,#DB#,From [#PRGenesis 6:5--7#MD#Then God, seeing that the wickedness of men was great upon the earth and that every thought of their heart was intent upon evil at all times, repented that he had made man on the earth. And being touched inwardly with a sorrow of heart, he said, #DQI will eliminate man, whom I have created, from the face of the earth, from man to other living things, from animals even to the flying things of the air. For it grieves me that I have made them.#DQPR#], God destroyed sinful humans. This is akin to the second world war, where the allied forces annihilated the Germans and Japanese to prevent further destruction of lives and properties . . . This is not unjustified cruelty. God destroyed the sinful humans to prevent them from influencing their would-be descendants of their sins . . . This is justified cruelty.,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30
Divine>God Exists>Philosophy->Biblical errors,#DB#,The Bible has several errors; and hence cannot be trusted, including its claim that God exists.,#DB#,By shallow reasoning, its appears the Bible indeed has several errors. For example, it states that God commanded the Israelites to kill several tribes, including women and children [<a href="https://www.bethinking.org/bible/old-testament-mass-killings">Paul Coulter</a>, <a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2494730/jewish/Torah-and-Genocide-FAQ.htm">Tzvi Freeman</a>]. #LF# Before dealing with this error, let us consider other information First, a marble was presented to Leonardo da Vinci who rejected due to its low quality [<a href="http://changingthetimes.net/samples/10to16/da_vinci_agrees_to_sculpt_david.htm">Jeff Provine</a>]. It is accepted by Michaelangelo who carved it into the beautiful statue of David, that can be seen in the Vatican. The lesseon here is the acceptance of undesirable and its transformation into a beautiful object. #LF# Second, the writing of the Bible is like the writing of a child guided by his mother. If the mother alone will write, the result would be beautiful. However, as she is only guiding her son, the writing is crooked. Thus, even though the things written in the Bible have God#@#s permission (like the guiding mother), it does not necessarily mean they are true (because of the child). As God is loving, He cannot allow the murder of the innocent tribes. He is just used by the Bible#@#s authors to justify their cruel character. This is how base the morals of the early Israelites. One has to understand the Bible based on the type of society surrounding its authors. #LF# Now, if only human shapes the character of the Israelites, their character might still be base until Jesus Christ came. Even though their character is base in the beginning, like Michaelangelo, God accepted them and shapes their character to become good. This claim is supported by the fact that many of their descendants were ready to accept Christian principles (e.g., the incarnation of God written in the Old Testament). Considering that the Israelite may not be able to transform themselves from being base and yet their descendants were ready for Christian principles, the existence of God who shapes their character makes sense. In summary, the cruelty written in the Bible as commanded by God are not actually commanded by Him, instead the Bible just shows that He receives a base people, and He shapes (i.e., loves) them that supports His existence. #LF# There could be wrong science-related statements in the Bible. The Bible is not a Science book; instead, it was created to teach people to love God and their fellow humans. Thus, whatever science-related statements written in the Bible are not declared as true or false by the church.,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30
Divine>God Exists>Philosophy->Snake,#DB#,The Bible is false since a paradise with a snake is nonsensical.,#DB#,Humans have inherent attitude to indulge in positive sensation. Due to the freedom God gave us, a person may act to indulge in positive sensations even if these can harm him/her or other people (e.g., substance abuse). This is akin to the story of Adam and Eve; as they would like to taste the sweetness of the forbidden fruit and they have the freedom to act, they suffered. Thus, the story did not really happened, such that, there is no snake in paradise #DS this is just a parable to illustrate that the propensity to indulge in positive sensation, and the freedom, of humans sometimes make him commit sin. The freedom is granted by God out of His love of humans, and the propensity is necessary for us to grow when geared to goodness (e.g., creating TV for entertainment).,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30

For example, consider the imaginary number i, and the complex number z = x + iy where x and y are real values. The derivative of z* with respect to z was proven not to exist [#PRStein, Elias M and Shakarchi, Rami#MD#author: Stein, Elias M and Shakarchi, Rami#CR#title: Complex analysis#CR#volume: 2#CR#publisher: Princeton University Press#CR#year: 2010PR#]. #LF# Thus, it is not necessary that the non-existence of God has no proof.

Divine>God Exists>Science->Invisible God,#DB#,God does not exist as nobody had seen Him.,#DB#,In Science, there are invisible entities but believed to exist. For example, gravity cannot be seen and yet accepted as existent. The black holes (no light can escape from it due to its extreme gravitational pull) are believed to exist, even they cannot be seen, as they fit other theories and observations in Physics [#PRHoffert, Barbara#MD#author: Hoffert, Barbara#CR#title: Black Holes: The Key to Understanding the Universe#CR#publisher: REED BUSINESS INFORMATION 360 PARK AVENUE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA#CR#year: 2022PR#].

What if the cause of consciousness is not matter nor energy (the only ones Science can investigate)? Thus, the hard problem may not possibly be explained by Science but rather by positing a God who gave it. Aside from it, Science cannot even solve the measurement problem in Quantum Mechanics [#PRMuller, F.#MD#author: Muller, F.#CR#title: Non-Reflexive Logics, Non-Individuals and the Philosophy of QuantumMechanics#CR#journal: Nuclear Physics B#CR#publisher: Springer-Verlag#CR#year: 2023PR#].,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30
Divine>God Exists>Science->Chance,#DB#,The formation of all things is just by chance and not by God.,#DB#,Given a problem to explain, the sensible and preferred explanation is the one that has the strongest explanatory power among all the pertinent explanations. For example, the laws of Physics are more powerful to explain multitude of observations on non-stochastic events, whereas chance as an explanation is inapplicable. Now, with regards to explanation, chance is not powerful than God. Thus, the claim is the opposite of sensible choice of explanation. It is then more sensible to believe that God created, rather than chance formed, the universe. #LF# If even reason is formed only by chance (not anchored in reality) one cannot be confident that what he/she learns corresponds to reality. Who knows, by random neural processes ones brain comes to believe that an object is real but not in fact. In addition, one cannot also trust his/her ability to know, as this can also be the result of chance and detached from reality. If chance causes our reason it is not clear if why we have reason and why we believe it.,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30
Divine>God Exists>Science->Evolution,#DB#,The complicated cell constituting the body of living organisms are formed by chance and evolution over a long time.,#DB#,There are myriad of molecules that when formed quickly disintegrate if not attached to form the primordial living cell. The disintegration is akin to the oxidation of the cells of the sliced areas of a fruit that turn brown after few hours. Now, considering their number and difference in chemistry, it is extremely unlikely that the said molecules are formed simultaneously, such that, even if one is formed the others already disintegrate. In addition, their attachment needs to be in correct order; otherwise the cell cannot be formed, will not last long, or will not produce an offspring. Thus, the molecules need to be formed simultaneously then attached quickly in correct order to form the complex primordial living cell; otherwise they will disintegrate yielding no cell [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v36_v4hsB-Y">James Tour</a>]. This process is a miracle if happened by chance. It is similar to a junk yard explosion where metal pieces fly then accidentally fall into place in correct order to form a functioning fighter jet. #LF# Let us say that the molecules are attached one by one and after a long period, by chance the primordial living cell is formed (this is referred to as chemical evolution). However, as stated, it is necessary for the molecules to be attached quickly, otherwise each of them will disintegrate and no primordial living cell be formed. In fact, time is the enemy of organic compounds [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v36_v4hsB-Y">James Tour</a>]. Thus, even after a long period of time of chemical evolution, still no primordial living cell can be formed.

Divine>God Exists>Science->Goldilocks,#DB#,No wonder the physical laws of the universe are goldilocks (carefully chosen) for life to exist since if they are not, then we are not here to admire the universe.,#DB#,This reasoning is similar to saying that a thousand sharp shooters fire on a person and by chance this person is not hit, otherwise he is dead. This is stupidity in not investigating the true cause of the person not being hit. The shooters might deliberately miss him and just wanted to scare him.

The tilma is made of weak cactus fiber that usually disintegrates after 15 to 20 years, but still preserve to this day. Using a microscope, the eyes of the woman in the image can be seen to have the reflection of humans likely present when the image in the tilma was first shown. This artistic feature cannot be achieved by any human on 1531 A.D. [<a href="https://www.catholiccompany.com/magazine/the-miraculous-image-of-our-lady-of-guadalupe/">Gretchen Filz</a>]. This must be a miracle. #LF# Bonus: The mantle of the woman in the image has a figure of stars referred to here as the mantle stars. In place of the mantle stars, let us put holes and then let us move to the back of the tilma. The holes can be seen to match the group of stars in heaven, referred to as mantle stars, during the first time the image was revealed. Above the mantle stars is another group of stars called corona. Suppose another set of holes are made on the tilma corresponding to the corona stars, such that, all the corona and mantle stars can be seen through the tilma holes at a single appropriate viewing point behind the tilma. With this set up, the holes corresponding to the corona stars are found to be above the head of the woman.

On 2004, the flesh was examined by Professor Frederick Zugibe of Columbia University, New York, an expert in cardiac pathology and forensic medicine. He is an atheist and does not know that the flesh was from a consecrated host.

The Greek empire is the dominion of geniuses, such as, Pythagoras, Archimedes, Aristotle, etc. who developed knowledge that is being taught until now in school. The Roman empire is the most powerful among the empires in the first set, its lingua franca is the language of the last empire (this is why most books in the Bible are written in Greek even if it written during the Roman empire), and eagle is its symbol. #LF# The second set is composed of the Spanish, British and American empires.

And praying, they said: #DQMay you, O Lord, who knows the heart of everyone, reveal which one of these two you have chosen, to take a place in this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas prevaricated, so that he might go to his own place.#DQ And they cast lots concerning them, and the lot fell upon Matthias.

And having sold it, was it not in your power? Why have you set this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God!#DQ Then Ananias, upon hearing these words, fell down and expired. And a great fear overwhelmed all who heard of it. And the young men rose up and removed him; and carrying him out, they buried him.

And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy. And your youths shall see visions, and your elders shall dream dreams. And certainly, upon my men and women servants in those days, I will pour out from my Spirit, and they shall prophesy.

And this shall be: whoever shall invoke the name of the Lord will be saved.#SQ Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus the Nazarene is a man confirmed by God among you through the miracles and wonders and signs that God accomplished through him in your midst, just as you also know. This man, under the definitive plan and foreknowledge of God, was delivered by the hands of the unjust, afflicted, and put to death. And he whom God has raised up has broken the sorrows of Hell, for certainly it was impossible for him to be held by it. For David said about him: #SQI foresaw the Lord always in my sight, for he is at my right hand, so that I may not be moved. Because of this, my heart has rejoiced, and my tongue has exulted. Moreover, my flesh shall also rest in hope. For you will not abandon my soul to Hell, nor will you allow your Holy One to see corruption. You have made known to me the ways of life. You will completely fill me with happiness by your presence.#SQ Noble brothers, permit me to speak freely to you about the Patriarch David: for he passed away and was buried, and his sepulcher is with us, even to this very day. Therefore, he was a prophet, for he knew that God had sworn an oath to him about the fruit of his loins, about the One who would sit upon his throne. Foreseeing this, he was speaking about the Resurrection of the Christ. For he was neither left behind in Hell, nor did his flesh see corruption. This Jesus, God raised up again, and of this we are all witnesses. Therefore, being exalted to the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the Promise of the Holy Spirit, he poured this out, just as you now see and hear. For David did not ascend into heaven. But he himself said: #SQThe Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.#SQ Therefore, may the entire house of Israel know most certainly that God has made this same Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.#DQ Now when they had heard these things, they were contrite in heart, and they said to Peter and to the other Apostles: #DQWhat should we do, noble brothers?#DQ Yet truly, Peter said to them: #DQDo penance; and be baptized, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of your sins. And you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the Promise is for you and for your sons, and for all who are far away: for whomever the Lord our God will have called.#DQ And then, with very many other words, he testified and he exhorted them, saying, #DQSave yourselves from this depraved generation.#DQPR#, #PRActs 3:6--7#MD#But Peter said: #DQSilver and gold is not mine.

Thus, what Jesus Christ mentioned in [#PRMatthew 23:9#MD#And do not choose to call anyone on earth your father. For One is your Father, who is in heaven.PR#] is just an exaggeration. This is to show to the scribes and Pharisees how sinful and proud they are when they did not humbly look at the Father as the unique teacher, instead they view themselves as the sole authority to teach and as the father of the Israelites. #LF# St. Paul said in [#PREphesians 3:14--15#MD#By reason of this grace, I bend my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, from whom all paternity in heaven and on earth takes its name.PR#] that God the Father (patera in Latin) and all fatherhood (patria in Latin) are derived from the participation on His fatherhood. Considering [#PRMatthew 23:9#MD#And do not choose to call anyone on earth your father. For One is your Father, who is in heaven.PR#], it can be understood that Jesus Christ did not admonished the participation, but rather the usurpation, of the fatherhood of God.

Enticed by the belief, it is sensible to theorize that after a person is saved, he would not hesitate to commit sins as he believes he will not pay them for being already saved.

The God of the people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people, when they were settlers in the land of Egypt. And with an exalted arm, he led them away from there. And throughout a time of forty years, he endured their behavior in the desert. And by destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan, he divided their land among them by lot, after about four hundred and fifty years. And after these things, he gave them judges, even until the prophet Samuel. And later on, they petitioned for a king. And God gave them Saul, the son of Kish, a man from the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. And having removed him, he raised up for them king David. And offering testimony about him, he said, #SQI have found David, the son of Jesse, to be a man according to my own heart, who will accomplish all that I will.#SQ From his offspring, according to the Promise, God has brought Jesus the Savior to Israel. John was preaching, before the face of his advent, a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. Then, when John completed his course, he was saying: #SQI am not the one you consider me to be.

And when they had fulfilled everything that had been written about him, taking him down from the tree, they placed him in a tomb. Yet truly, God raised him up from the dead on the third day. And he was seen for many days by those who went up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who even now are his witnesses to the people. And we are announcing to you that the Promise, which was made to our fathers, has been fulfilled by God for our children by raising up Jesus, just as it has been written in the second Psalm also: #SQYou are my Son. This day I have begotten you.#SQ Now, since he raised him from the dead, so as to no longer return to corruption, he has said this: #SQI will give to you the holy things of David, the faithful one.#SQ And also then, in another place, he says: #SQYou will not allow your Holy One to see corruption.#SQ For David, when he had ministered to his generation in accordance with the will of God, fell asleep, and he was placed next to his fathers, and he saw corruption. Yet truly, he whom God has raised from the dead has not seen corruption. Therefore, let it be known to you, noble brothers, that through him is announced to you remission from sins and from everything by which you were not able to be justified in the law of Moses. In him, all who believe are justified. Therefore, be careful, lest what was said by the Prophets may overwhelm you: #SQYou despisers! Look, and wonder, and be scattered!

And he stationed the cherubim in the middle of the inner temple. And the cherubim extended their wings, and the wing of the one was touching the wall, and the wing of the second cherub was touching the other wall. But the other wings, in the middle of the temple, were touching each another.

There were two rows cast of striated sculptures. And it was standing upon twelve oxen, of which three were looking toward the north, and three toward the west, and three toward the south, and three toward the east. And the sea above was over them. And their posteriors were entirely hidden within. And the basin was the thickness of three twelfths. And its brim was like the brim of a chalice, or like the outturned petal of a lily. It contained two thousand baths. And he made ten bases of brass: each base was four cubits in length, and four cubits in width, and three cubits in height. And the work itself of the bases was engraved; and there were sculptures between the junctures. And between the little crowns and the edges, there were lions, and oxen, and cherubim; and similarly in the junctures above. And under the lions and oxen were something like bands of brass hanging down. And each base had four wheels, with axels of brass. And at the four sides were something like little arms, under the cast basin, facing away from one another. Also, the mouth of the interior of the basin was at the top of the head. And what was visible outside was of one cubit all around, and altogether it had one cubit and a half. Now at the corners of the columns were diverse engravings. And the spaces between the columns were square, not round. And the four wheels, which were at the four corners of the base, were joined to one another under the base. The height of one wheel held one cubit and a half. Now these were the kind of wheels such as are often made for a chariot. And their axels, and spokes, and tires, and centers were all cast. And the four little arms, which were at each corner of a base, were cast and joined together as part of the base itself. And at the summit of the base, there was a round stand of one half cubit, fabricated so that the basin could be placed upon it, having its engravings, and various sculptures of its own. He also engraved those plates, which were of brass. And at the corners were cherubim, and lions, and palm trees, standing out, as if in the likeness of a man, so that they seemed not to be engraved, but placed adjacent on all sides. In this manner, he made ten bases with the same casting and measure, and very similar engravings. He also made ten hand basins of brass. One hand basin contained four baths, and was of four cubits. And each basin he set upon a base, which is ten bases. And he stationed the ten bases, five to the right side of the temple, and five to the left. And the sea he placed to the right side of the temple, opposite the east, toward the south.PR#] [<a href="https://www.catholic.com/qa/how-can-the-church-allow-statues-when-exodus-20-forbids-it">Catholic Answers</a>].,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30

If she envisioned to have sexual relationship with St. Joseph, she would not wonder on she would get pregnant. This means she did not envisioned; and that she has the plan to remain a virgin till eternity. #LF# The Jews have tradition in the past that when their wives are slept by other men then they will not sleep with the wives any more.

This tradition (seeming translation error) is due to the fact that there is no corresponding word for cousin, and cousins are referred to as brothers, in Hebrew.

There is always the Bible theme about sex prohibition when people are around holy entities.

They found under the tunic of each of the dead men objects consecrated to the idols of Jamnia, which the Law forbade the Jews to wear. So it became clear to everyone why these men had died. Everyone blessed the intervention of the Lord, the just Judge who brings to light the most secret deeds; and they prayed to the Lord to completely pardon the sin of their dead companions. The valiant Judas urged his men to shun such sin in the future, for they had just seen with their own eyes what had happened to those who sinned. He took up a collection among his soldiers which amounted to two thousand pieces of silver and sent it to Jerusalem to be offered there as a sacrifice for sin. If they did not believe that their fallen companions would rise again, then it would have been a useless and foolish thing to pray for them. But they firmly believed in a splendid reward for those who died as believers; therefore, their concern was holy and in keeping with faith. This was the reason why Judas had this sacrifice offered for the dead - so that the dead might be pardoned for their sin.PR#]. The fallen warriors are not in heaven as they still have sins. They are not in hell as there is no salvation there. (b) Expressed in [#PRMatthew 5:25--26#MD#Be reconciled with your adversary quickly, while you are still on the way with him, lest perhaps the adversary may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you will be thrown in prison.

Meaning, there are sins committed by a person that can be forgiven after death. This person cannot wait in hell as there is no forgiveness there. He/she cannot enter heaven right after death as he/she has still sins.

Social>Homosexuality->Born,#DB#,Born this way.,#DB#,There are human characters developed but not inherent. For example, no one is born a drunkard. Even one unconsciously chose, he/she will become alcoholic if he/she is frequently drunk. Thus, following the same reasoning, a man may become homosexual (even if he did not chose this) if he habitually thinks of his sexual desires for other men. #LF# Even if a man is born with same-sex attraction, he does not mean he needs to follow this emotion [<a href="https://www.catholic.com/tract/homosexuality">Catholic Answers</a>].,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30

This destroys the intimacy of couples when one of them is addicted to pornography [<a href="https://www.catholic.com/magazine/online-edition/three-things-you-need-to-know-about-pornography">Matt Fradd</a>]. The change in intimacy is the cause of 56% of divorce, said the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers. The destruction also perverts the sexual acts of the couple and so as marriage, which is the core of the family, which is the pillar of society. The last statement is supported by the apparent moral decline of the western civilization. #LF# Further, wives who learn of their husband#@#s addiction to pornography experienced fatigue, loss of appetite in eating and libido, anxiety, and depressions. Tragically, they are the ones blamed for their husband#@#s addiction to pornography [<a href="https://www.catholic.com/magazine/print-edition/pornography-is-destroying-marriages">Matt Fradd</a>]. #LF# Moreover, some people (e.g., Ted Bundy [<a href="https://www2.cbn.com/news/us/serial-killer-ted-bundy-describes-dangers-pornography">Luke Gibbons</a>], Dennis Rader [<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/wicked-deeds/202202/evolution-serial-killer-dennis-rader-btk">Scott A.

Social>Substance Abuse->Recreation,#DB#,Is it detrimental to consume recreational substance?,#DB#,A substance may not be destructive, but the objective on using it could be. For example, the use of progestogen to abort a fetus is bad; but its use to cure menstrual pain is good. #LF# Now, the perceived information by a person under the influence of substances may not correspond to reality. Thus, the outcomes of substance abuse could be: change in reaction to reality; becoming distant from reality; psychological illness (e.g., insanity); and loss of desire to savour the good things in the world. Therefore, his personality (formed by his interaction with reality) will be perverted due to substance (or pornography) addiction. In response, the Pontifical Council for Health and Pastoral Care proclaimed that pleasure not stimulated by reality is bad [<a href="https://www.catholic.com/magazine/print-edition/is-it-wrong-to-alter-your-mind-for-fun">Catholic Answers</a>].,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30
Social>Substance Abuse->Mental cure,#DB#,Why medicines for mental illnesses are not prohibited?,#DB#,Medicines for mental illnesses (e.g., anti-depressants) are not prohibited as the objective is not to move the perception of the sick person #NKSocial>Substance Abuse->RecreationL#KawayKN# from reality (unlike in substance abuse) but rather to alleviate his/her suffering. However, the sick must not become dependent of the medicine.

Social>Substance Abuse->Wine,#DB#,Is drinking wine prohibited by the Catholic church?,#DB#,Drinking wine is not prohibited by the Catholic church if its purpose (e.g., to become calm) is for physical and/or mental health. Thus, wine is classified in the Cathechism of Catholic Church (number 2290) as food and not as a drug. However, drinking wine is prohibited by the Catholic church if its purpose is for recreation, as it will move #NKSocial>Substance Abuse->RecreationL#KawayKN# the drinkers mind from reality (that leads to many accidents) [<a href="https://www.catholic.com/magazine/print-edition/is-it-wrong-to-alter-your-mind-for-fun">Catholic Answers</a>].,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30

Social>Proposed Government Form->Proposed government,#DB#,What is the remedy on the weakness of the US constitution on morality?,#DB#,The US constitution is meritorious in minimizing the chance of power abuse by US government officials, such as in having check and balance due to the executive, judiciary and legislative branches of government. However, #NKSocial>Proposed Government Form>Constitutional Republic->Republic based on ConstitutionL#KitKN# has a weakness on #NKSocial>Divorce->DangerL#KmoralityKN# which can be eradicated if this is #NKSocial>Homosexuality->DangerL#KrepealedKN#, such that, morality-related #NKSocial>Substance Abuse->PornographyL#KlawsKN# derived from it will #NKSocial>Abortion->DangerL#KconformKN# with that of the Catholic moral standards. However, the Catholic church prohibits divorce, pornography, homosexuality, and abortion. The problem is, American wants freedom from the prohibitions, freedom which they see as paid by the blood of their compatriots; and no one will vote for a politician who will defend the prohibition. Thus, it is extremely challenging to repeal the US constitution. #LF# The defiance of Americans on the prohibitions can lead to the #NKSocial>Proposed Government Form>Constitutional Republic->Collapse of Roman EmpireL#KcollapseKN# of their nation, where they will be raped, killed or persecuted by foreign or domestic enemies. If weighted, the fruits of the defiance is more painful than the sacrifice of following the prohibitions. #LF# Now, the government has the duty to defend the stability of the nation it governs. If the defiance of the prohibitions (made by the Catholic church) will lead to the collapse of the nation, then it is just common sense that the government has the duty to (and must) implement the prohibitions. The typical solution of the government to national problems is political only and not religious, i.e., to separate church and state. However, any political or administrative strategy will not yield a better society if the people tasked to implement it are immoral. For instance, the Mafia paid some judeges to absolve one of theirs, that impeded Mayor Rudy Giuliani to quickly eliminate New York crimes. #LF# Thus, the US constitution needs to be repealed in order for the morality-related laws derived from it will conform to the morality of the Catholic church; but it does not mean that priests will run the government. This is the type of constitution advocated in this app, not only for the USA but for the whole world. #LF# However, the changes in the constitution can be implemented if the citizens of a nation are faithful to their faith, otherwise they will just rebel, and nothing will happen to the changes. Therefore, there is a need to propagate or re-evangelize the Catholic faith where you can help. Go. And spread this app to everyone.,#DB#,1,#DB#,0,#DB#,07/07/2023 07:30

Social>Proposed Government Form>Communism->Leaders,#DB#,The leaders of Communism generally do good for their nation.,#DB#,From the experiences of many, humans has the propensity to abuse their power. For example, an infant will not stop crying just to get what he/she needs (e.g., milk or toy). Annoyed by the cries, his/her mother to satisfy his/her wants, i.e., his/her cries becomes a power that he/she abuses. Thus, if humans are given absolute power, more likely he/she will bring absolute devastation as he/she is inherently abusive of power. #LF# In communism, the state has absolute power [#PRKengor, Paul#MD#author: Kengor, Paul#CR#title: The Devil and Karl Marx: Communism#@#s Long March of Death, Deception, and Infiltration#CR#publisher: Amazon#CR#year: 2020PR#]. However, a nation is an abstract entity; the one that actually has power are its leaders who seem to only know of what is good for the nation and the rest are like innocent children. Thus, they are the ones who have absolute power (enhanced by no election) used to whatever they think is good, e.g., force sharing of agricultural products and services [#PRMarx, K.#MD#author: Marx, K.#CR#title: Early Writings#CR#publisher: McGraw-HillPR#].
